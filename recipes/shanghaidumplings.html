        <ol>
            <li> <strong>Reserve</strong> 1/4 cup (35g) flour and place the remaining flour in a bowl. 
                Add 1/4 cup (60ml) boiling water and stir to combine. 
                Gradually add another 1/2 cup (125ml) boiling water, stirring until a dough just begins to form. 
                Add 1/4 cup (60ml) cold water and the oil and stir to combine. </li>

            <li> <strong>Transfer</strong> dough to an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook and knead for 5-6 minutes until smooth and elastic, adding the remaining flour if the dough is too sticky. 
                Enclose in plastic wrap and set aside to rest for 30 minutes. </li>
           
            <li> <strong>For the filling,</strong> combine all ingredients in a bowl and season well. Set aside.  </li>
            
            <li> <strong>Divide</strong> the dough into 4 equal pieces and roll each piece into a log about 3cm in width. Cut the dough into pieces about the size of a golf ball.  </li>
            
            <li> <strong>On a lightly floured surface,</strong> roll the balls out until 2mm thick and cut out 10cm circles. 
                Top a dough round with 1 tablespoon filling, and bring the edges together to form a dumpling, pinching the tops to seal. 
                Repeat with remaining dough and filling, keeping the filled dumplings covered with a damp tea towel while you make the rest.  </li>
            
            <li> <strong>Arrange</strong> cabbage leaves in a steamer. In batches, arrange the dumplings in the steamer and steam for 8-10 minutes until cooked through. </li>
            
            <li> <strong> Combine </strong> the black vinegar and ginger in a small bowl and serve with the dumplings and sliced chilli. </li>
