            <li> <strong>Sauté Vegetables:</strong> Add the sesame oil into a large pot and heat over medium heat. 
                Add in the garlic and ginger and sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant. 
                Add in the sliced mushrooms and cook for 3-5 minutes or until softened. </li>

            <li> <strong>Add Liquids:</strong> Pour in the chicken stock, water, and soy sauce. </li>
            <li> <strong>Simmer:</strong>> Then bring to a boil and simmer for about 5 minutes. </li>
            <li> <strong>Cook Bokchoy:</strong> Add the bokchoy and then simmer for an additional 2 minutes to soften the leaves. </li>
            <li> <strong>Add Noodles:</strong> Remove the pot from the heat. 
                Then place the ramen noodles in the hot pot of broth. 
                Allow the noodles to sit for ONLY a couple of minutes until they loosen and soften up. 
                The noodles will soften quickly, so this should be done right before serving.  </li>
            <li> <strong>Transfer to Serving Bowls:</strong> Divide the ramen, veggies, and broth evenly into bowls. </li>
            <li> <strong>Add Toppings:</strong> Top the ramen with sliced grilled chicken and soft boiled eggs. 
                Then garnish with toppings of choice and <em>enjoy!</em> </li>
